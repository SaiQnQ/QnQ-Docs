Disadvantage 1: Inflexibility to Changes
	Sample Example: The Road Trip Rigidity

	Imagine you’re planning a road trip with your parents using the Waterfall method. Before starting, you map out the entire route, decide on all the stops, book hotels, and even plan your meal breaks—all in a fixed 	sequence. Everything is set in stone, and there’s no room for deviation.

	But halfway through the trip, you find an exciting detour—a scenic route that promises amazing views and a famous chai shop. Unfortunately, since the itinerary is fixed, your parents insist on sticking to the original plan, 	saying, “We can’t change now, we’ve already booked everything!” The trip becomes a drag as you miss out on spontaneous adventures and new experiences.

	Agile Approach: With Agile, your trip would be more flexible. You’d have a general plan but adapt it along the way. If you discover a cool detour, you’d take it without hesitation, making the journey more enjoyable and 	memorable.

Disadvantage 2: Late Testing
	Sample Example: The Biryani Disaster

	You’re cooking biryani for a big family gathering using the Waterfall method. You follow the recipe step by step—marinate the meat, cook the rice, layer everything, and then cook it all together. But because you don’t 	taste it along the way, you only realize the salt is off after it’s fully cooked. Now, you’re stuck with a huge pot of bland biryani and no way to fix it easily.

	Agile Approach: In Agile, you’d taste-test the biryani as you add each ingredient, adjusting the spices to get the flavor just right before it’s too late.


Disadvantage 3: High Risk and Uncertainty
	Sample Example: The Dream Home Dilemma

	You’re building your dream home, and you follow the Waterfall method—design the entire house first, get it approved, then start construction. Halfway through, you realize that the kitchen is too small for your needs, 	but since the walls are already up, fixing it means tearing down and rebuilding, costing a fortune.

	Agile Approach: With Agile, you would build and review one section at a time, adjusting the design as you go. If the kitchen needs to be bigger, you catch it early and adapt without the need for expensive rework.

Disadvantage 4: 4.	Customer Involvement
	Sample Example: The Surprise Birthday Cake

	You’re in charge of ordering a birthday cake using the Waterfall method. You gather all the requirements at the start—flavor, size, design—and place the order. On the day of the party, you unveil the cake, only to find out 	that the birthday girl actually hates chocolate, and you ordered a giant chocolate cake. Since feedback wasn’t gathered during the process, the cake is a flop.

	Agile Approach: In Agile, you would check in with the birthday girl or her family throughout the process, adjusting the flavor or design based on feedback to ensure she loves the final product.

Disadvantage 5: Long Time to Market
	Sample Example: The Festival Outfit Fiasco

	You’re planning your Diwali outfit using Waterfall. You first buy the fabric, then get it tailored, and lastly, purchase matching accessories. But by the time your outfit is ready, you realize that the latest fashion trend has 	changed—everyone is now wearing Indo-western fusion, and your traditional outfit looks outdated.

	Agile Approach: In Agile, you’d shop and tailor your outfit in smaller cycles, allowing you to stay on top of current trends and adjust your outfit plans as fashion evolves.
