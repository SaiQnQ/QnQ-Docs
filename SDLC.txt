SDLC
Water Fall method:


1. Requirements:
	FRD Walk through
	
2. Design:
3. Development:
4. Testing:
	Certify their exit criteria
5. Development:
	Approval from the Product Owner (Definition of done, Expectation criteria)

6. Maintenance:

Advantages of SDLC Waterfall model

Easy to Understand
Individual Processing
Clear Milestones

Disadvantages:

No feedback path
Difficult to accommodate change Requests:
No Overlapping
Limited Flexibility
Limited Stakeholder Involvement
Late Defect Detection
Lengthy Development Cycle


When to Use Waterfall:

Well-understood Requirements
Very Little Changes Expected
Small to medium-Sized Projects
Predictable
Regulatory Compliance
Limited resources


Agile is principle

Roles:

Events: Ceremonies

Sprint Planning
Daily Planning
Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospection


Artifacts:

Product Backlog (All Requirements of PO)
Sprint Backlog (Requirement taken in a particular Sprint by DEV)
Increment - Working Software Ready to Deploy Stage  (MVP)

Sprint - (2-4 Weeks)
Complex EPIC, break into small US (User Story). Estimation - BA

EPIC

US (User Story)

INVEST Criteria
INVEST is an acronym for Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small (Simplicity), and Testable. These are the six key components of the INVEST criteria that must be present for a User Story to be considered high quality.

Product backlog refinement (Arranging in a proper way)
Prioritization

If( INVEST Criteria DOR - Definition of ready ) {
	Product backlog --> Sprint Backlog
        Estimation(time)
}
Estimation(time){
	Man Days
	time Negotiation with data points
	Start SDLC()
}
Start SDLC(){
	...
	DailyStatusReport
	...

	if(Impediment or Blockers){
		Escalate to SM
	}

	SprintReveiw()
}

SprintReveiw(){
	1. PO, SM Extremely Important Call
	2. FRD and All Mails are Mandatory
	
	DOD (Definition of done) by PO
	If(Approved){
		Production
	}else{

Spring Pillars:

Transparency

Adaptation


5 Values of Scrum:

Commitment

Openness - Predicting the defects before
Respect
Courage - Able to express to authorized

Story Point

It is a Relative Estimation Comparision. Between PB to SB

After US - INVEST Criteria
A - US 
B - US

A = x
B = 2x

Experienced Resource - 0.5 Day, 1 Day
Less Exp Resource A= 2 Day, 4 Day

Considerations of Story Point:

1. The Amount of Work
2. Complexity
3. Risk (Not clear Requirement) and Uncertainty (We are going to new technology, which we haven't used before)

Low amount of work, high Complexity - Business algorithm. HR Consultancy ?

Work amount is work, Complex = V2, V3,



Velocity

Retrospection:


1. Start, Stop and Continue
2. Sailboat technique - Wind, Rock, Anchor, Sun
3. Mad, Sad, Glad Technique
4. 4L Technique - Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For
5. Starfish technique - 5
	a. Start Doing
	b. Stop Doing
	c. Less of
	d. Keep doing
	e. More of


Agenda of retrospection:

What went well
What did not go well
What can be improved
